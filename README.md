# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NerdTheJinx
I am a graduating computer science student from a beautiful country calls **Malaysia** who is making his first step to contribute ideas to open-source projects. 

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development and problems solving.
I used to be a web developer using PHP and JavaScript to build robust internal web-based systems for small enterprises.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build scalable services with Java and Docker.
I am currently shifting my career focus to Java microservices development for the beauty of the architecture for building robust & scalable systems. 

### ðŸ“« Feel free to email me @ jameshoe_0904@live.com should you have any interesting ideas you can't wait to share with me.
